# Logistic-Regression-for-Iris-Dataset
I implement Logistic Regression algorithm and apply this to Iris dataset. I didn't use sklearn.LogisticRegression but implement the algorithm in detail, which may be helpful to understand the principle of Logistic Regression.
* `iris.txt` is iris dataset in txt format
* `Logistic Regression.py` is the Python code for the algorithm.
  - I creat a LogisticRegression class, which is convenient to call in other program. 
  - If you want to add some new features in the LogisticRegression class, you can edit the source code of defining the class.
* There are two figures, which are convergence curve and confusion matrix respectively. You can also run the code to get them.
