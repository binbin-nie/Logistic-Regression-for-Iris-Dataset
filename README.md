# Logistic-Regression-for-Iris-Dataset
I implement Logistic Regression algorithm and apply this to Iris dataset. I didn't use sklearn.LogisticRegression but implement the algorithm in detail, which may be helpful to understand the principle of Logistic Regression.
* `Logistic Regression` folder is the Python code for the algorithm. 
  - I creat a LogisticRegression class, which is convenient to call in other program. 
  - If you want to add some new features in the LogisticRegression class, you can edit the source code of defining the class.
* `Test Iris Dataset.py` is the testing program for Logistic Regression algorithm on Iris dataset.
* There are two figures in the `figures` folder, which are convergence curve and confusion matrix respectively. You can also run the code to get them.
